## 👉 What's This All About?

Hey there! This is my personal homelab documentation – a living knowledge base where I document everything from infrastructure setup to those 3 AM debugging sessions that teach you *way* too much about Linux networking.

**TL;DR:** I run a small datacenter in my home office because cloud bills are scary and self-hosting is so fun.

## 🤔 Why Self-Host?

> "The cloud is just someone else's computer" – Ancient IT Proverb

**Reasons I run a homelab:**

1. **Learning** – Best way to understand infrastructure
2. **Privacy** – My data stays on my hardware
3. **Cost** – Cloud bills add up fast, even faster than electricity ones
4. **Fun** – Because it's actually so enjoyable
5. **Curiosity** - It's amazing to see how things work
6. **Control** – I decide when things update (or break)
